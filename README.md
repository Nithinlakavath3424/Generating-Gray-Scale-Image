Grayscale Image Generation using CNNs

This project is an implementation of generating grayscale images layer by layer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The neural network architecture is designed to generate grayscale images progressively, adding layers to enhance detail and complexity.

Overview :

Generating grayscale images layer by layer using CNNs is an interesting application of deep learning in computer vision. Instead of directly generating the entire image at once, this approach generates images progressively, adding layers to refine details and create more realistic outputs.

Features :

Progressive generation of grayscale images layer by layer
Enhancement of detail and complexity with each layer added
Flexible architecture for experimentation and customization

Usage :

Train the CNN model using the provided dataset or your custom dataset.
Once the model is trained, use the trained model to generate grayscale images layer by layer.
Experiment with different network architectures, training parameters, and input configurations to achieve desired results.
